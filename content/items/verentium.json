  "description": "A material designed to aid advanced machinery and components using it's high conductivity and charge.",
  "details": "Verentium's particularly weak structure is a result, or, for a lack of a better word, a byproduct of it's high charge. The material contains so much charge to the point of harming it's chemical component and therefore making the material weaker in terms of durability.",
