# s2p

A _(JSON)_ Mindustry mod that I'm actually going to put effort into.

An experimental mod.

:warning: ```WARNING!``` :warning:
- **UNFINISHED CONTENT**
  - I will add the effects _(and perhaps proper/custom sound effects)_ for blocks after I'm done/finished with their core functions. _This also applies for their sprites._
- **UNFINISHED PLANET**
  - May switch planet from JSON to JavaScript/Java _(if possible)_
  - The planet is not yet meant to be played. It serves as a sort of template for me to improve upon.
- **UNFINISHED SPRITES**

**Everything** here is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**!

Current content _("Balanced" for Serpulo)_:
```json
"Turrets": "Broadside",
           "Venerate, Deference",
           "Sovereign"

"Units": "Hymn, Anthem, (Serenade), (Symphony), (Euphony)",
         "Portent, (Premonition), Doomsday, (Hereafter), (Damnation)",
         "Misanthrope, (Naysayer), (Despondent), (Nihilist), (Unbeliever/Fatalist)"
       
"Items": "Verentium, Draetheus Alloy, Actium"

"Liquids": "Camber Coolant"

"Status Effects": "Destabilized, Shutdown",
                  "Meltdown, Regeneration"
       
"Planets": "Concord"
```
