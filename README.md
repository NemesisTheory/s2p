abandoned project. Now 'ported' to Java. `dawneProject`

#

### s2p

~~A _(JSON)_ Mindustry mod that I'm actually going to put effort into.~~

~~An experimental mod.~~

# ~~`WARNING!`~~
- ~~**UNFINISHED CONTENT**~~
  - ~~I will add the effects _(and perhaps proper/custom sound effects)_ for blocks after I'm done/finished with their core functions. _This also applies for their sprites._~~
- ~~**UNFINISHED PLANET**~~
  - ~~May switch planet from JSON to JavaScript/Java _(if possible)_~~
  - ~~The planet is not yet meant to be played. It serves as a sort of template for me to improve upon.~~
- ~~**UNFINISHED SPRITES**~~

~~**Everything** here is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**!~~

#
~~Current content _("Balanced" for Serpulo)_:~~
###### ~~I still can't decide if the content here deserves to go to Concord to become planet-exclusive tech, or for Concord to be a "3rd" planet.~~
###### ~~Names within brackets are *planned* content that's *bound* to be added.~~
