# s2p

A _(JSON)_ Mindustry mod that I'm actually going to put effort into.

An experimental mod.

:warning: ```WARNING!``` :warning:
- **UNFINISHED CONTENT**
  - I will add the effects _(and perhaps proper/custom sound effects)_ for blocks after I'm done/finished with their core functions. _This also applies for their sprites._
- **UNFINISHED PLANET**
  - May switch planet from JSON to JavaScript/Java _(if possible)_
  - The planet is not yet meant to be played. It serves as a sort of template for me to improve upon.
- **UNFINISHED SPRITES**

**Everything** here is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS**!

###### i need help with the planets :skull:
